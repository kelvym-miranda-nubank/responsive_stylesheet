### What are the default values for the breakpoints?

- `xs: 0` From 0 screen width until 479
- `sm: 480` From 480 screen width until 767
- `md: 768` From 768 screen width until 991
- `lg: 992` From 992 screen width until 1199
- `xl: 1200` From 1200 and beyond

> All values from here came from other libraries and responsive Front End frameworks.

### Can I customize the breakpoints?

**Today, no**. But it's in the have a way to do this but the names `xs`...`xl` will remain part of the library to make it easier to use the abstractions.
